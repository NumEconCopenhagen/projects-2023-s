# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Exploring the Links Between GDP per Capita, Life Expectancy, and Happiness: A Cross-National Analysi** and examines the relationships between GDP per Capita, Life Expectancy, and Happiness Score across nations, aiming to uncover the factors contributing to well-being and quality of life.

We apply the **World Happiness Report datasets from 2015 to 2019**:

1. 2015.csv (*kaggle*) 
2. 2016.csv (*kaggle*) 
3. 2017.csv (*kaggle*) 
4. 2018.csv (*kaggle*) 
5. 2019.csv (*kaggle*) 
6. world-happiness-report.csv (*merging of the above*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``pip install plotly``
